    overview: |
        My time at Amdocs was truly transformative. Working on the LESOG (Local Exchange Service Order Generator) project was a defining experience, where I had the chance to be part of an incredible journey to modernize a legacy system by transitioning it to Java Spring Boot Application. It was both challenging and rewarding to see how our work improved the system’s performance and made a tangible impact. 
        
        Beyond the technical achievements, what stands out the most are the people I worked with—their support, collaboration, and camaraderie made every challenge worthwhile. The lessons I learned there, both personal and professional, continue to guide me, and I’m deeply grateful for the memories, mentors, and friends I gained along the way.
