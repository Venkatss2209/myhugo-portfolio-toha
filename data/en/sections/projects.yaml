- name: LESOG
  summary: |
    LESOG (Local Exchange Service Order Generator) receives LSR from CLEC through Frontend Systems to LASR. LASR receives the XML input file does initial validation (VER, PON verification) stores the input file for record keeping and sends the LSR to LESOG. LESOG receives the LSR from LASR does 1st Level & 2nd Level validation, generates the Service Order and sends response back to LASR. LESOG interfaces to different mainframe systems (BOCRIS, BOCABS, ICLOC, TIRKS, RSAG, ATLAS, COFFI, LFACS etc) for data acquisition and entry. LESOG generates service orders from LSRs submitted LASR, updates the Service Order in SOCS and sends the response message (successful/failure) back to LASR.
